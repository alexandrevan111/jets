title: Jobs

A Jets job handles background jobs. They run outside of the web request/response cycle. Here's an example:

app/jobs/hard_job.rb:

```ruby
class HardJob < ApplicationJob
  class_timeout 300

  rate "10 hours" # every 10 hours
  def dig
    puts "done digging"
  end

  cron "0 */12 * * ? *" # every 12 hours
  def lift
    puts "done lifting"
  end
end
```

`HardJob#dig` will run every 10 hours and `HardJob#lift` will run every 12 hours.

You can check for the job functions in the Lambda console:

You can also see associated CloudWatch Event Rule in the CloudWatch console:

## Running Jobs Explicitly

You can run jobs explicitly with code. Example:

```ruby
event = {key1: "value1"}
HardJob.perform_now(:dig, event)
HardJob.perform_later(:lift, event)
```

In the example above, the `perform_now` results in the job running in the **same process**.

The `perform_later` runs the job by calling the AWS Lambda function associated with it in a **new process**.  It usually runs a few seconds later.
