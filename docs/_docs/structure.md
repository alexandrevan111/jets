The `jets new` command generates a new project with the following directory structure:

    .
    ├── app
    │   ├── controllers
    │   ├── helpers
    │   ├── javascript
    │   ├── jobs
    │   ├── models
    │   └── views
    ├── bin
    ├── config
    ├── db
    ├── public
    └── spec

The table below states the purpose of each directory:

File / Directory  | Description
------------- | -------------
app/controllers  | Contains controller code that handles API Gateway web requests. For more info refer to [controllers]({% link _docs/controllers.md %})

app/helpers  | Contains helpers methods that can be used to assist view code.

bin  | Contains helper executables.
config  | Contains configuration files for databases, routes, webpacker, etc.  Application-wide configurations are set in [config/application.rb]({% link _docs/app-config.md %}).
