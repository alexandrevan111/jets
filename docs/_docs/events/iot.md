Jets supports [IoT Events](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-events/). This allows you to have a Lambda function run when IoT data is received.  You provide a SQL statement to define an [IoT Topic Rule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-rules.html).  You can access the data via `event`.

## IoT Overview

## Simple Form

At a minimum, you need to define the SQL statement to use query the Topic Rule. This is the simplest and recommended form.

```ruby
class ThermostatJob < ApplicationJob
  iot_event "SELECT * FROM 'my/topic'"
  def measure
    puts "event #{JSON.dump(event)}"
  end
end
```

The `iot_event` declaration creates an [AWS::IoT::TopicRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iot-topicrule.html).

## Complete Form: Control with Different Argument Types

If you need more control, you can also set any of the properties of the `topic_rule_payload` by providing a hash.

```ruby
class ThermostatJob < ApplicationJob
  iot_event(sql: "SELECT * FROM 'my/topic'")
  def record
    puts "event #{JSON.dump(event)}"
  end
end
```

For even more control, you can provide a hash that has a `topic_rule_payload` key. This will provide you full control over the properties passed to the [AWS::IoT::TopicRule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iot-topicrule.html) resource.

```ruby
class ThermostatJob < ApplicationJob
  iot_event(topic_rule_payload: {sql: "SELECT * FROM 'my/topic'"})
  def act
    puts "event #{JSON.dump(event)}"
  end
```

## Event Payloads

The event payload received is whatever is sent by the device to [MQTT]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/view-mqtt-messages.html).  You can test in the MQTT console.

You can also test with the [aws iot-data publish](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iot-data/publish.html) cli:

    aws iot-data publish --topic my/topic --payload '{"message": "test"}'

You should see the data in the Lambda function's CloudWatch logs.
