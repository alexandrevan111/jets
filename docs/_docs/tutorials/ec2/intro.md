title: Tutorial EC2
---

In the following sections, we'll walk through a tutorial using an [Amazon EC2 instance in a security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/sample-templates-services-us-west-2.html#w2ab2c23c48c13c15).

1. We'll import the template from the AWS Documentation Sample.
2. Explore the lono project and familiarize ourselves with some of the [directory structure]({% link _docs/directory-structure.md %}).
3. Make some adjustments by adding and removing a route53 record.
4. Launch 2 versions of the stack.

This will give you a chance to learn how lono works and experiment with the lono commands. By the end, hopefully, you'll have a good sense of how things work.

Let's start!
