To create your own Shared Resource Extensions, you define a module with the methods in the `app/shared/extensions` folder.  Here's a simple example:

app/shared/extensions/sqs_extension.rb:

```ruby
module SqsExtension
  def sqs_queue(logical_id, props={})
    defaults = { message_retention_period: 120 }
    props = defaults.merge(props)
    resource(logical_id, "AWS::SQS::Queue", props)
    output(logical_id)
  end
end
```

After the module is defined, you can use the method in your [Shared Resource]({% link _docs/shared-resources.md %}) like so:

app/shared/resources/list.rb

```ruby
class List < Jets::Stack
  sqs_queue(:fastpass, receive_message_wait_time_seconds: 20)
end
```

The code above creates an SQS Queue with a `message_retention_period` of 120 seconds and a `receive_message_wait_time_seconds` of 20 seconds.  By creating your own resource extensions you can shorten your code and remove duplication.

Note: The `sqs_queue` is an example and is actually already implemented by Jets. We're using it for demonstrative purposes.
