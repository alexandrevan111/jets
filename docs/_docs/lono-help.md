title: Lono Help
---

You can run help for quick help information right at the CLI.  Example:

```sh
lono help
```

You can append `help`, `-h` or `--help` to the end of any command to get more helpful information about that specific command.  These all work.

```sh
lono new -h
lono import -h
lono generate -h
lono summary -h
lono cfn create -h
lono cfn update -h
```
