## RubyGems

You can also install lono via RubyGems.

```sh
gem install lono
```

Or you can add lono to your Gemfile in your project if you are working with a ruby project.  It is not required for your project to be a ruby project to use lono.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "lono"
{% endhighlight %}

## Bolts Toolbelt

If you want to install lono without having to worry about lono's ruby dependency you can install the Bolts Toolbelt which has lono included.

```sh
brew cask install boltopslabs/software/bolts
```
