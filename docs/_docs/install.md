## RubyGems

You can also install jets via RubyGems.

{% highlight sh %}
gem install jets
{% endhighlight %}

Or you can add jets to your Gemfile in your project if you are working with a ruby project.  It is not required for your project to be a ruby project to use jets.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem "jets"
{% endhighlight %}

## Bolts Toolbelt

If you want to install jets without having to worry about jets's ruby dependency you can install the Bolts Toolbelt which has jets included.

{% highlight sh %}
brew cask install boltopslabs/software/bolts
{% endhighlight %}
