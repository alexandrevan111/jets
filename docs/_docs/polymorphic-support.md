## What is polymorphic support?

Polymorphic support is the Jets ability to write your lambda functions in other languages like python or node.

## Why polymorphic support?

Jets is a Ruby Serverless Framework.  While it strongly encouraged to use Ruby when writing Jets code to avoid switching mental context, there are use cases where it makes sense to use other languages with Jets.

For example, there are a ton of lambda examples written in other languages. In these cases, it is convenient to take the lambda functions wholesale, add it to your Jets project, and move on with life.  This is a reason why Jets has polymorphic support.
