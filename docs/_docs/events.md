Jets is also a powerful Glue Serverless Framework.

AWS Lambda supports many event triggers.  With event triggers, you can use Lambda functions as glue. Here's a list of the events supported by Jets.

<ul>
{% assign event_docs = site.docs | where: "categories","events" %}
{% for doc in event_docs %}
  <li><a href='{{doc.url}}'>{{doc.title}}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

The next sections cover the event triggers.

<a id="prev" class="btn btn-basic" href="{% link _docs/env-extra.md %}">Back</a>
<a id="next" class="btn btn-primary" href="{% link _docs/events-cloudwatch-rule.md %}">Next Step</a>
<p class="keyboard-tip">Pro tip: Use the <- and -> arrow keys to move back and forward.</p>
