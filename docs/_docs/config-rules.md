title: Config Rules
---

Jets supports creating [AWS Config Rules](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) and associating them with lambda functions.  First, make sure you have a `app/rules/application_rule.rb`:

```ruby
class ApplicationRule < Jets::Rule::Base
  rule_namespace false
end
```

The config rule classes you create will look something like this:

```ruby
class SecurityGroupRule < ApplicationRule
  desc "ensures security groups are hardened"
  scope "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
  def protect
    check = SecurityGroupCheck.new(event, context)
    check.run
  end
end
```

In `app/models`, the SecurityGroupCheck class might look something like this:

```ruby
class SecurityGroupCheck
  APPLICABLE_RESOURCES = ["AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"]

  def run
    invoking_event = JSON.load(event['invokingEvent'])
    configuration_item = invoking_event['configurationItem']
    rule_parameters = JSON.load(event["ruleParameters"])

    evaluation = evaluate_compliance(configuration_item)

    put_evaluations(
      evaluations: [
        {
          compliance_resource_type: configuration_item['resourceType'],
          compliance_resource_id: configuration_item['resourceId'],
          compliance_type: evaluation['compliance_type'], # required, accepts COMPLIANT, NON_COMPLIANT, NOT_APPLICABLE, INSUFFICIENT_DATA
          annotation: evaluation['annotation'],
          ordering_timestamp: configuration_item['configurationItemCaptureTime'], # required
        },
      ],
      result_token: event['resultToken'], # required
    )
  end
  ...
end
```

## Polymorphic Rules

AWS has provided many starter config rules at [awslabs/aws-config-rules](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-rules).  Most of them are written in [python](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-config-rules/tree/master/python). Jets allows you take these python methods and use them as-is.  For example, you could save these python lambda functions in the `app/workers/rules/protect_rule` folder like so:

```
app/rules/protect_rule/python/ec2_exposed_instance.py
app/rules/protect_rule/python/iam_mfa.py
```

Then in your Rule class, you would use [Jet's polymorphic ability](http://rubyonjets.com/docs/polymorphic-support/):

```ruby
class ProtectRule < ApplicationRule
  scope "AWS::EC2::Instance"
  python :ec2_exposed_instance

  scope "AWS::IAM::User"
  python :iam_mfa
end
```

Jets will create Python lambda functions using the files in the `app/rules/protect_rule/python` folder and associate the Config Rules with these functions.  This saves you time from rewriting the python code.

## Managed Config Rules

[AWS Config Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/evaluate-config_use-managed-rules.html) are rules pre-built rules created by AWS.  For example, there's a [iam-password-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/iam-password-policy.html) rule that you can set up to prove that your AWS account follows a strong password policy. AWS support a ton of [Managed Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html).  You use AWS managed rules and custom lambda based rules similarly:

```ruby
class CheckRule < ApplicationRule
  desc "CIS 4.1 - Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22"
  scope "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
  managed_rule :incoming_ssh_disabled
end
```

Here's a screenshot example of the both types of rules mixed together:

## Rule Namespace

The config rule classes above inherited from an `ApplicationRule` class that set the `rule_namespace` to `false`. This is because often times config rules apply to the entire AWS account removing the namespace helps to shorten the names of the provisioned config rules. If you would like to change this behavior you can remove the `rule_namespace` line.

```ruby
class CheckRule < ApplicationRule
end
```

Or you can set your own namespace:

```ruby
class CheckRule < ApplicationRule
  rule_namespace "cis"
end
```
