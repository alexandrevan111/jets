The Jets community is small and growing.  There are some benefits with a smaller community as you‚Äôll have a better chance of getting to know folks. You will likely find other folks who are interested in Jets and just figuring things out also. Would love for community members to be helpful and point others in the right direction. We've all been there before, and sometimes the littlest tip goes a long way to help others.
