title: Quick Start
---

In a hurry? No problem!  Here's a quick start to get going.

{% highlight bash %}
jets new demo
cd demo
jets generate scaffold Post title:string
edit .env.development # adjust to your local database creds
jets db:create db:migrate
jets server
open http://localhost:8888/posts # check out the site
{% endhighlight %}

The `jets server` command starts a server that mimics API Gateway so you can test locally.  Once you're ready, deploy to AWS.

{% highlight bash %}
edit .env.development.deploy # adjust to your remote database creds
jets deploy
{% endhighlight %}

Jets deploy will launch a few CloudFormation templates that will deploy your app as lambda functions and API Gateway routes.

Congratulations!  You have successfully deployed your serverless ruby application. It's that simple. üòÅ
