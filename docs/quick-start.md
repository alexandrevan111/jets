title: Quick Start
---

In a hurry? No problem!  Here's a quick start to using jets that will get you going.

{% highlight bash %}
jets new demo
cd demo
jets generate scaffold Post title:string
jets db:create db:migrate
jets server
open http://localhost:8888/posts
{% endhighlight %}

The last command does a few things:

1. Generate templates and params files from `app/definitions` and `app/templates` to `output/templates`.
2. Generate parameter files from `config/params` to `output/params`.
3. Use the `output` files to launch a CloudFormation stack.

The example launches an EC2 instance with a security group. Check out the newly launch stack in the AWS console:

Congratulations!  You have successfully created a CloudFormation stack with lono. It's that simple. üòÅ

```
