# Based on Rails MiddlewareStackProxy
#
# Configurator is a proxy for the Jets middleware stack that allows
# you to configure middlewares in your application. It works basically as a
# command recorder, saving each command to be applied after initialization
# over the default middleware stack, so you can add, swap, or remove any
# middleware in Jets.
#
# You can add your own middlewares by using the +config.middleware.use+ method:
#
#     config.middleware.use Magical::Unicorns
#
# This will put the <tt>Magical::Unicorns</tt> middleware on the end of the stack.
# You can use +insert_before+ if you wish to add a middleware before another:
#
#     config.middleware.insert_before Rack::Head, Magical::Unicorns
#
# There's also +insert_after+ which will insert a middleware after another:
#
#     config.middleware.insert_after Rack::Head, Magical::Unicorns
#
# Middlewares can also be completely swapped out and replaced with others:
#
#     config.middleware.swap ActionDispatch::Flash, Magical::Unicorns
#
# And finally they can also be removed from the stack completely:
#
#     config.middleware.delete ActionDispatch::Flash
#
