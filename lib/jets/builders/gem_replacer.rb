Your project requires compiled gems were not available in any of your lambdagems sources.  Unavailable pre-compiled gems:
<% missing_gems.each do |gem| %>
* <%= gem -%>
<% end %>

Your current lambdagems sources:
<% Jets.config.lambdagems.sources.map do |source| %>
* <%= source -%>
<% end %>

Jets is unable to build a deployment package that will work on AWS Lambda without the required pre-compiled gems. To remedy this, you can:

* Build the gem yourself and add it to your own custom lambdagems sources. Refer to the Lambda Gems Docs: http://rubyonjets.com/docs/lambdagems
* Wait until it added to lambdagems.com. No need to report this to us, as we've already been notified.
* Use another gem that does not require compilation.

Compiled gems usually take some time to figure out how to build as they each depend on different libraries and packages. We make an effort add new gems as soon as we can. You can support us by going to: http://rubyonjets.com/support-jets/
