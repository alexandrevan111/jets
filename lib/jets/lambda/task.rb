  # The get_type method works for controller and job classes.
  #
  # Usually able to get the type from the class name. Examples:
  #
  #   PostsController => controller
  #   HardJob => job
  #
  # However, for function types, we are not able to get the type for multiple of
  # reasons.  First, function types are allowed to be named with or without
  # _function.  Examples:
  #
  #   path => class => type
  #   app/functions/hello.rb => Hello => function
  #   app/functions/hello_function.rb => HelloFunction => function
  #
  # The second reason is that functions are not regular ruby classes. Instead they
  # are anonymous classes created with Class.new.  When classes are created with
  # Class.new the method_added hook has "" (blank string) as the self class name.
  # We add the class_type to the task later on as we are constructing the class
  # as part of the Class.new logic.
  #
  # For controller and job standard ruby classes though it can easily be
  # determinated as part of initialization. So we get the type for convenience then.
  #
  # For anonymous function classes, we just set to nil and will later fix in
  # FunctionConstructor.
  #
  # Returns: "controller", "job" or nil
