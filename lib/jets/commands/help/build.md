Builds a zip file package to be uploaded to AWS Lambda. This allows you to build the project without deploying and inspect the zip file that gets deployed to AWS Lambda. The package contains:

* your application code
* generated shims

If the application has no Ruby code and only uses Polymorphic functions, then gems are not bundled up.
