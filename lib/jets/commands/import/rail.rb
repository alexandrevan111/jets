        Congrats! The Rails project from #{@source} has been imported to the rack folder.  Here are some next steps:

        # Local Testing

        Check out the config/routes.rb file and noticed how a new catchall route has been added.  It looks something like this:

            any "*catchall", to: "jets/rack#process"

        The catchall route passes any route not handled by the Jets app as a request onto the Rails app.  You can modified the route to selectively route what you want.

        Test the application locally. Test that the Rails app in the rack subfolder works independently.  You can start the application up with:

            cd rack # cd into the imported Rails project
            bundle exec rackup

        The rack server starts up on http://localhost:9292  You might have to make sure that the database is configured.

        Once tested, stop that server with CTRL-C.

        Then you can start the jets server from the main jets project:

            cd .. # back to the main jets projet
            jets server # starts both jets and rack servers

        The jets server starts up on http://localhost:8888  You can stop both servers with CTRL-C.

        # Deploy

        When you're ready deploy to AWS Lambda with:

            jets deploy
      EOL
    end
  end
end
