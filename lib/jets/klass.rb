# Loading a class can usually be loaded via .constantize.
# But app/functions files are anonymous ruby classes created with
# Class.new.  Anonymous classes cannot be loaded via .constantize and
# go through standard autoloading.
#
# Jets::Klass provides a way to load app classes in app/controllers, app/jobs,
# app/functions in a consistent way without having to worry about the anonymous
# class loading quirk. Classes that are not anonymously defined like controllers
# and jobs are loaded via autoloading with .constantize. Anonymously defined
# classes like functions are loaded via Object.const_set.
#
# Examples:
#
#   Jets::Klass.from_path("app/controllers/posts_controller.rb")
#   Jets::Klass.from_path("app/jobs/hard_job.rb")
#   Jets::Klass.from_path("app/functions/hello.rb")
#   Jets::Klass.from_path("app/functions/hello_function.rb")
#
#   Jets::Klass.from_task(task)
#
# The from_task method takes a Jets::Lambda::Task as an argument and is useful
# for the CloudFormation child stack generation there the registered task info
# is available but the path info is now.
