# AWS supports their own cron-like expression. Here's an example:
EasyJob#sleep:
  cron: "0 12 * * ? *" # every day at 12:00pm UTC
  args:
    k1: v1
    k2: v2
# Here's more cron expressions examples:
#
# every day, at 5 and 35 minutes past 2:00pm UTC
#   cron: "5,35 14 * * ? *"
#
# 10:15am UTC on the last Friday of each month during the years 2002 to 2005
#   cron: "15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005"
#
# The extra `args` must be a Hash. The AWS Scheduled Event gets merges into
# this args Hash and any same keys will get overwritten.  So chose unique keys.
# Here's a sample Scheduled Event:
# {
#   "account": "123456789012",
#   "region": "us-east-1",
#   "detail": {},
#   "detail-type": "Scheduled Event",
#   "source": "aws.events",
#   "time": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z",
#   "id": "cdc73f9d-aea9-11e3-9d5a-835b769c0d9c",
#   "resources": [
#     "arn:aws:events:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/my-schedule"
#   ]
# }
#

# AWS also supports a rate expression.  It takes a unit plus a unit of time.
# Valid units of times are: minute, minutes, hour, hours, day, days
#
# Example:
HardJob#dig:
  rate: 5 minutes

# More rate expressions:
#
# every 3 hours
#   rate: "3 hours"
#
# everyday
#   cron: "1 day"
