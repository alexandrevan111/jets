# Configuring Job Rate
#
# AWS scheduled events supports a rate expression.  It takes a unit plus a
# unit of time. Valid units of times are: minute, minutes, hour, hours, day, days
# Rate expression examples:
#
# every 3 hours:
#   rate: "3 hours"
#
# everyday:
#   cron: "1 day"
#
# AWS supports their own cron-like expression. AWS Cron expressions examples:
#
# every day at 12:00pm UTC:
#   cron: "0 12 * * ? *"
#
# every day, at 5 and 35 minutes past 2:00pm UTC:
#   cron: "5,35 14 * * ? *"
#
# 10:15am UTC on the last Friday of each month during the years 2002 to 2005:
#   cron: "15 10 ? * 6L 2002-2005"
#
# Sample Data
#
# All job methods have the `event` and `context` available. Here's an example of what that data looks like:
#
# event:
#   {
#     "account": "123456789012",
#     "region": "us-east-1",
#     "detail": {},

#     "resources": [
#       "arn:aws:events:us-east-1:123456789012:rule/my-schedule"
#     ]
#   }
#
# context:
#   {
#     "callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop": true,
#     "logGroupName": "/aws/lambda/demo-dev-2-posts-controller-new",
