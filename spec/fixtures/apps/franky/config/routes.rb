  # Catchall routes at the root level work differently in local development
  # than on AWS API Gateway.  Locally, the rack middleware routes the static
  # files directly never hits Jets.  On AWS though, there is no rack middleware
  # it's all API Gateway.  So for a root level catchall route like
  #
  #    any "*catchall", to: "public_files#show"
  #
  # It cannot be tested locally - at least, I'm don't how to do that yet.
